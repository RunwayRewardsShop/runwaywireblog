Let's buckle up in our metaphorical DeLorean and revisit the rich, vibrant trends that continue to shape contemporary fashion.</p>\n<h2>Power Suits: Dressing to Impress</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./powersuit.jpg\" alt=\"80s Power Suit\">\nPower suits with shoulder pads were in vogue during this transformative era. They emanated a sense of strength and ambition, especially among women. As Michael Douglas stated through his iconic character Gordon Gekko in Wall Street, \"greed is good\". This encapsulated the Yuppie- short for young urban professionals- mindset which was key in influencing the fashion trends of this era.</p>\n<h2>Bright and Bold: Make Your Mark with Neon</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./neon.jpg\" alt=\"Neon trend of the 80s\">\nNeon was everywhere during the 80s, i.e., clothes, accessories, and bands. These striking hues became a fashion statement- a visual shout out to the world that screamed \"Hey, look at me!\"</p>\n<h2>Punk: The Rebellion Continues</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./punk80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Punk\">\nPunk fashion took new forms in the 80s - bands began to adopt a more hardcore and aggressive look with leather jackets, ripped jeans, and band t-shirts, becoming a complete lifestyle.</p>\n<h2>The Mini Skirt: Flaunt it if You’ve got it!</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./miniskirt80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Miniskirts\">\nFirst introduced in the swinging 60s, the miniskirt lived on in the 80s but with a twist. Denim, leather, and even lycra miniskirts started becoming a staple in everyone's wardrobe, reflecting the boldness of the era.</p>\n<h2>Rocking the Radical: Wild Hair Dos</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./wildhair80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Wild Hair\">\nBigger was better when it came to hair in the 80s. Business-casual mullets, hair metal perms, and new-wave extension experiments defined the decade, representing another facet of radical self-expression during the era.</p>\n<h2>Distressed to Impress: Acid-Washed Denim</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./acidwash80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Acid-Washed Denim\">\nThis style might seem extreme today, but acid-washed denim was all the rage in the 80s. Initially invented using pumice stones for a faded appearance, acid wash jeans gave a weathered and rugged look treasured by many fashion enthusiasts during the 80s.</p>\n<h2>Fitness &#x26; Fashion: Comfort in Style</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./fitness80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Fitness Fashion\">\nIn the 80s, fitness wasn't limited to the gym - it was a cultural phenomenon that influenced fashion significantly. Leg warmers, leggings and stirrup pants coupled with high-energy aerobics classes defined the era. Moreover, people often donned their athletic gear out on the town, whether or not they intended to exercise.</p>\n<h2>Adding Color to Life: A Makeup Revolution</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./makeup80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Makeup\">\nThe 80s were all about vibrant, boundary-pushing visual styles. The onset of music television during this period made visual expression more important, driving people to reflect these styles in everyday life using extravagant makeup.</p>\n<h2>The Showstoppers: Hair Accessories</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./scrunchies80s.jpg\" alt=\"80s Scrunchies\">\nThe scrunchie, a fabulously strong hair tie covered in varying colors and fabrics was the must-have hair accessory of the 80s. This versatile accessory complemented a wide array of styles, from the yuppie look to the neon trend.</p>\n<h2>Turn Up The Heat: Miami Heat Inspired Wardrobes</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/72e01/miamivice.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Miami Vice Look\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/828fb/miamivice.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/ff44c/miamivice.jpg 158w,\n/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/a6688/miamivice.jpg 315w,\n/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/828fb/miamivice.jpg 630w,\n/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/0ede0/miamivice.jpg 945w,\n/static/7f4682480b8cf6135af6a3dfea6a0e52/72e01/miamivice.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\nPopular TV shows like 'Miami Vice' also influenced fashion with white sport coats, pastel colors, designer stubble and Ray-ban wayfarers becoming staples in everyone's wardrobe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The 80s gave birth to countless enduring styles.
